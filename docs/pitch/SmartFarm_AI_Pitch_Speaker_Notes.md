# SmartFarm AI – Speaker Notes (8–10 minutes)

Time budget guide (adjust per audience):
- Problem + Why Now: 1:00
- Solution + Product: 2:00
- How It Works (Tech): 2:00
- Impact + Differentiation: 1:30
- GTM + Model + Roadmap: 2:00
- Ask + CTA: 0:30

## Slide 2 – Problem
- Open with the human context: smallholders feed the world but face water stress, disease, and volatile prices.
- Emphasize timeliness and practicality—advice must work on modest hardware and connectivity.

## Slide 3 – Solution
- Frame it as decisions across the crop lifecycle: scout, irrigate, plan, sell.
- Note the "graceful degradation" design—always-on advice even in low-compute settings.

## Slide 4 – Product
- Demo path: launch dashboard, use one image to show disease analysis, highlight recommendation clarity.
- Mention the API for integration and the one-click scripts.

## Slide 5 – How It Works
- Keep it accessible: “CNN for images, RL to optimize water, ensembles for yield, NLP for market cues.”
- Stress transparency and confidence intervals; fallbacks are documented and safe.

## Slide 6 – Why We Win
- Reduce friction: runs without heavy installs; teachable with notebook; simple for pilots.

## Slide 7 – Impact
- Provide conservative ranges and note assumptions (calendar-based irrigation baseline, etc.).

## Slide 8 – Validation
- CI tests prove endpoints stay healthy; quick demo on a standard laptop.

## Slide 9 – GTM
- Start with training cohorts via NGOs/universities; then field pilots.

## Slide 10 – Business/Adoption
- Options: open core + paid support; partner-funded pilots; premium integrations.

## Slide 11 – Roadmap
- On-device disease detection and offline bundles resonate strong in rural contexts.

## Slide 12 – Team & Advisors
- Tailor this: add local agronomy partners; highlight regional expertise.

## Slide 13 – Ask
- Be specific about pilot regions, datasets needed, and timeline.

## Slide 14 – CTA
- End with how fast it is to try and the repo link.
