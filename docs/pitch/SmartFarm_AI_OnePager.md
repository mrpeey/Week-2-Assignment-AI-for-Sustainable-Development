# SmartFarm AI – One Pager

## The Problem
Smallholder farmers face three compounding risks: water scarcity, crop disease, and price volatility. Tools are fragmented, and heavy AI stacks often don’t run in real contexts.

## The Solution
A modular, lightweight AI toolkit to support the full crop cycle:
- Disease detection (CV) with treatment suggestions
- Yield prediction (ensembles + NN) with confidence intervals
- Smart irrigation (RL) to keep soil moisture optimal and save water
- Market intelligence (NLP) to time sales
- Classroom‑ready notebook and a simple dashboard for adoption

## Why It’s Different
- Runs in lightweight mode without heavy installs or GPUs
- Clear explanations and conservative defaults
- Windows‑friendly scripts, API for integration, tests and CI

## Impact (Conservative Ranges)
- +15–25% yield; −30–50% water use; +20–30% income resilience

## Users & Channels
- Farmers, extension officers, cooperatives; via NGOs, universities, gov programs

## Roadmap
- Satellite NDVI, sensors, weather APIs; on-device models; offline bundles; multilingual UI

## Call to Action
Try the dashboard/API in 5 minutes and propose a community pilot.
