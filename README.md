### 🌱 Project Overview

This project addresses **UN SDG 2: Zero Hunger** by developing an integrated AI-driven agricultural intelligence system that helps farmers optimize crop production, reduce food waste, and increase agricultural sustainability. The system combines multiple machine learning techniques from Week 2 concepts including supervised learning, neural networks, NLP, and reinforcement learning.
